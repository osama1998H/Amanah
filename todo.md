# To-Do Checklist for Amanah Project

## Initial Setup
- [x] Set up a Git repository for version control.
- [x] Define the project structure and directory layout.
- [x] Create a README file with an overview of the project.
- [x] Set up a Go module (`go mod init`).
- [ ] Install necessary dependencies and libraries.

## Core Development

### Transaction Management
- [ ] Design the API endpoints for transaction lifecycle (initiate, check status, cancel, refund).
- [ ] Implement transaction state transitions (pending, authorized, completed, failed, refunded).
- [ ] Add concurrency control mechanisms (e.g., unique transaction IDs, locks).
- [ ] Implement idempotency for transaction processing.
- [ ] Integrate error handling and compensating actions.

### Account Abstraction
- [ ] Design APIs for account creation, profile management, and linking payment instruments.
- [ ] Implement account states (active, frozen, etc.) and KYC statuses.
- [ ] Ensure concurrency rules for account updates.
- [ ] Abstract account data management for loose coupling.

### Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Implement user login and API key validation.
- [ ] Set up token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
- [ ] Define role-based access control (RBAC).
- [ ] Integrate multi-factor authentication (if required).
- [ ] Secure credential storage and implement rate limiting.

### Payment Routing
- [ ] Design a unified interface for external payment gateway integration.
- [ ] Implement routing logic based on payment method, currency, or merchant preferences.
- [ ] Add retry mechanisms and failover strategies for external API calls.
- [ ] Ensure idempotency in communication with external systems.

### Notification Engine
- [ ] Design an event-driven notification system.
- [ ] Implement support for multiple channels (email, SMS, push notifications, webhooks).
- [ ] Add message templates and localization support.
- [ ] Implement retry logic for failed notifications.

### Ledger & Auditing
- [ ] Design an immutable ledger for financial transactions.
- [ ] Implement double-entry accounting or event sourcing.
- [ ] Add audit logging for non-financial events (e.g., logins, configuration changes).
- [ ] Ensure strong consistency for ledger entries.

## Architectural Practices
- [ ] Implement idempotency guarantees at the API layer.
- [ ] Design for service isolation (database-per-service pattern).
- [ ] Set up an event-driven communication system (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
- [ ] Add observability tools (logging, metrics, tracing).
- [ ] Ensure horizontal scaling and concurrency support.

## Security
- [ ] Enforce authentication and authorization checks at every service boundary.
- [ ] Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest.
- [ ] Implement PCI DSS compliance measures.
- [ ] Add rate limiting and anomaly detection.

## Testing and Observability
- [ ] Write unit tests for all modules.
- [ ] Set up integration tests for end-to-end flows.
- [ ] Implement sandbox mode for testing.
- [ ] Add structured logging and centralized log aggregation.
- [ ] Expose metrics endpoints for monitoring.

## Deployment
- [ ] Set up containerization (e.g., Docker).
- [ ] Configure orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes).
- [ ] Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
- [ ] Add health checks and readiness probes for services.

## Documentation
- [ ] Document APIs using OpenAPI/Swagger.
- [ ] Write developer guides for extending the framework.
- [ ] Provide examples for common use cases.

## Final Steps
- [ ] Review and finalize the MVP.
- [ ] Conduct a security audit.
- [ ] Prepare for the first release.
