# Project Structure for Microservices Support

## Overview
This document outlines the recommended project structure to support a microservices architecture. The structure is designed to ensure modularity, scalability, and maintainability.

## Root Directory Layout
```
Amanah/
├── services/          # Contains individual microservices
├── libs/              # Shared libraries and utilities
├── configs/           # Configuration files for different environments
├── deployments/       # Deployment scripts and manifests
├── docs/              # Documentation for the project
├── tests/             # End-to-end and integration tests
├── scripts/           # Automation and utility scripts
└── README.md          # Project overview and instructions
```

## Detailed Structure

### `services/`
Each microservice should have its own directory with the following structure:
```
services/
├── service-name/
│   ├── cmd/            # Entry points for the service
│   ├── internal/       # Internal packages (not exposed outside the service)
│   ├── pkg/            # Public packages (can be imported by other services)
│   ├── configs/        # Service-specific configuration files
│   ├── api/            # API definitions (e.g., OpenAPI specs, gRPC proto files)
│   ├── models/         # Data models and schemas
│   ├── handlers/       # Request handlers and controllers
│   ├── repositories/   # Data access logic
│   ├── services/       # Business logic
│   ├── tests/          # Unit tests for the service
│   └── Dockerfile      # Dockerfile for containerization
```

### `libs/`
Shared libraries and utilities that can be reused across multiple services:
```
libs/
├── auth/               # Authentication and authorization utilities
├── logging/            # Logging utilities
├── metrics/            # Metrics collection and reporting
├── utils/              # General-purpose utilities
└── README.md           # Overview of shared libraries
```

### `configs/`
Centralized configuration files for different environments:
```
configs/
├── development.yaml    # Development environment configuration
├── staging.yaml        # Staging environment configuration
├── production.yaml     # Production environment configuration
└── README.md           # Configuration guidelines
```

### `deployments/`
Deployment scripts and manifests for different environments:
```
deployments/
├── kubernetes/         # Kubernetes manifests
├── docker-compose/     # Docker Compose files
├── terraform/          # Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts
└── README.md           # Deployment instructions
```

### `docs/`
Project documentation:
```
docs/
├── architecture.md     # System architecture overview
├── api.md              # API documentation
├── setup.md            # Setup and installation instructions
└── README.md           # Documentation index
```

### `tests/`
End-to-end and integration tests:
```
tests/
├── e2e/                # End-to-end tests
├── integration/        # Integration tests
└── README.md           # Testing guidelines
```

### `scripts/`
Automation and utility scripts:
```
scripts/
├── db-migrate.sh       # Database migration script
├── cleanup.sh          # Cleanup script
└── README.md           # Script usage instructions
```

## Notes
- Follow the principle of "separation of concerns" to keep code modular and maintainable.
- Use consistent naming conventions across all directories and files.
- Ensure that shared libraries in `libs/` are well-documented and versioned.
- Keep environment-specific configurations in `configs/` and avoid hardcoding values in the code.
